# FlyHigh
A project for Engineering Big Data systems. A flight fare prediction system to predict the date of "pricefall" and the date of "cheapest travel"

# Description
Ever wondered if you would have booked that ticket earlier, then you would not have paid so much for that last minute ticket. Ever wondered, what is the date when you should book your tickets when you know that the prices are definitely going to be cheap? Well, to answer these simple questions we created a solution, for our Big Data Engineering project.
FlyHigh,helps monitor the date of pricefall for the ticket prices. It considers the historic data (previous 2 year airline fares) between source and destination and helps to predict the future prices for those flighs. It is important to note that for an airline ticket prices, there are certain key variables which are very important.
a. Source Airport
b. Destination Airport
c. Number of Available Seats
d. Oil Prices
